# Starter Application

Starter Application is a Ruby on Rails 5.1.1 template to use as a base for your new Rails applications. Ideally suitable for deployment on Heroku, but may be used elsewhere.

  - Clone repository or otherwise download source code and install gems
  - ???
  - Profit!

The starter application was developed using Rails 5.1.1, and Ruby 2.4.1. I make no guarantees, however I'm sure it can be adapted for use on other versions of Rails and Ruby.

## Demo

[Starter App for Rails 5.1.1 Demo](https://starter-app-rails5.herokuapp.com)

## Installation and use

1. Clone it (`git clone https://github.com/professorNim/starter-app-rails5`)
2. Bundle it (`bundle install`)
3. Run migration (`rails db:migrate`)
4. Develop your application

## Contributing

1. Fork it (https://github.com/professornim/starter-app-rails5/fork)
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create a new Pull Request

## Issues

If you encounter any issues, please try to first fix it yourself, and then propose a new pull request (see Contributing). If you have tried to solve the issue on your own, but are still in need of assistance, seek out help from Stack Overflow. If all else fails, open a new issue. While I will make every effort to integrate pull requests, I make no promises that I'll actively check the issues.

## Todo's

 - Write more tests

 ## Thanks

 Thanks to [Michael Hartl](https://github.com/mhartl) for his Rails Tutorial, a lot of this application is based on that
